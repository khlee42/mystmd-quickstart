MyST makes Markdown more _extensible_ & **powerful** to support an
ecosystem of tools for computational narratives, technical documentation,
and open scientific communication. You can **edit this demo** including the [frontmatter][myst-frontmatter] to change the title!!

:::{important} Our Values
We believe in a community-driven approach of open-source tools that are
composable and extensible. You can find out how to be involved in developing MyST Markdown by getting involved in the [ExecutableBooks][executable-books] project.
:::

MyST allows you to create figures with rich cross-references, scientific citations, and export to many commonly used document formats, including ([websites like this one][websites], [PDFs & $\LaTeX$][latex], [Microsoft Word][word], and [JATS XML][jats]).

For example, we have included a figure below ([](#my-fig)), [](#example-table) as well as [](#maxwell), a cross-reference to Maxwell's equations.
You can click on these and see the preview of the reference immediately.

## Including Figures and Images

## Including Math and Equations

```{math}
:label: maxwell
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \times \vec{e}+\frac{\partial \vec{b}}{\partial t}&=0 \\
\nabla \times \vec{h}-\vec{j}&=\vec{s}\_{e}
\end{aligned}
```

## Including Tables
